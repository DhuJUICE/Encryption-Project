# Encryption-Project
Encryption Program to encrypt and decrypt your private files using Python.
This is a small scale encryption program that me and a small team of students built.

 First ensure that python's tkinter is working by trying:
 "import tkinter"
 It should run without error
 Then you need to install pycryptodomex in cmd using:
 "pip install pycryptodomex"

After that last step you will be good to go and test the project. Have fun.
